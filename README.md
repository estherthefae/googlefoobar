# googlefoobar
This is my google foobar challenge experience from level 1 to 3 for now
So on the 9th of December, 2021, while looking up list comprehension in python, a wierd page appeared on my screen asking me if I wanted to accept some strange challenge and 
I accepted the challenge cuz I mean, why not, and then I was taken to this weird command line page and that's how I started the whole foobar journey
I took it really seriously back then when I heard Google used it as a means of hiring people but then I decided to take it as both a learning experience and a fun
experience as well and then if they contact me or not, at least I still gained something from the entire experience
So here are my submitted results for each of the challenges along the way
Hope they are explanatory enough. 
God bless!!
